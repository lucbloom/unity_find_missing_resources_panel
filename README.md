An interactive tool window that lists all the missing Assets, Scripts and Prefabs in your project.

This tool is superceded by my "Scan for GUIDs in file contents" tool, which finds ANY guid in ANY file in your project directory and detects where it is used (recursively), by using Regular Expressions.
